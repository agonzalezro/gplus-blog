First steps
===========

Before run the application, you must create a file called
``default_settings.py`` under your ``gplusblog`` path. This file must contain
your Google+ id and your Google+ api key, like on the example:

    GPLUS_ID = 'your_id_here'
    API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'

**Enjoy!**
